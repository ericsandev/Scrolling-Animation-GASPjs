 ## What was my process for creating this?

ðŸ”¥ The project leverages React for its component-based structure, making it easier to break down sections. Additionally, it utilizes Next.js to achieve Static Site Generation (SSG). Animated SVGs were created using CSS animations.

ðŸ”¥ The section scrolling and reveal animations are powered by GSAP, while card interactions are implemented with Tilt.js. The timeline section was constructed using a combination of JavaScript and SVGs, and was animated using GSAP.

ðŸ”¥ To ensure optimal performance, the animations, layer management, repaints, and re-layouts were optimized using Chrome DevTools.
